# elisa
A collection of Pygame - python game programming - tutorials, starting from a simple template and gradually moving up the ladder.

## Introduction and Motivation

Elisa is the set of examples and actual game code produced for the book "TODO:". The code is intended to guide you from being a beginner
in game programming to an beginner with some finished simple game and a concrete idea for where to look further in order to advance your
game development skills.

There is a host of topics that is typically associated with programming a game. In order to avoid
having to deal with too many things at once, we deliberately constrain the type of game we are going to produce to 
"TODO:". Consequently, you will (initially) not find elisa files for all aspects of a somewhat advanced game, but only
some starter code that deals with standard (and simple but fun) issues you would encounter in a simple single player game. 

## Mapping Intent to Source

- **start_template.py**:  
A simple template to kick our coding off. It is based on the official pygame starter code.
- **elisa_1_spritesheet.py**:
- **elisa_2_animation.py**:
- **elisa_3_multiple_animation.py**:
- **elisa_5_statemachine.py**:
- **elisa_6_environment_map.py**:
- **elisa_7_anim_statemachine.py**:
- **elisa_8_moving_in_environment.py**:
- **elisa_9_particles.py**:
- **elisa_10_screens.py**:
- **elisa_11_sound.py**:  
Play a single sound.
