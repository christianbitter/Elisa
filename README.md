# elisa
A collection of Pygame - python game programming - tutorials, starting from a simple template and gradually moving up the ladder.

## Introduction and Motivation

Elisa is the set of examples and actual game code produced for the book "TODO:". The code is intended to guide you from being a beginner
in game programming to an beginner with some finished simple game and a concrete idea for where to look further in order to advance your
game development skills.

There is a host of topics that is typically associated with programming a game. In order to avoid
having to deal with too many things at once, we deliberately constrain the type of game we are going to produce to 
"TODO:". Consequently, you will (initially) not find elisa files for all aspects of a somewhat advanced game, but only
some starter code that deals with standard (and simple but fun) issues you would encounter in a simple single player game. You may realize that over time the code files change or certain topics are introduced "between" alrady existing topics - whenever I feel there should have been something explained differently, a bug needs fixing, etc. ... invariably this will happen.

## Mapping Intent to Source

- **start_template.py**:  
A simple template to kick our coding off. It is based on the official pygame starter code.
- ""elisa_0_init.py**:  
Based of the initial template, we are going to look into pygame initialization procedures to arrive at a point where we have a displayed window and a double-buffer based drawing setup. For simplicity's sake we only fill the drawing canvas with white colour. But stay tuned for future examples.
- **elisa_0_1_drawing_shapes.py**:  
This is a simple example, building on geometric primitives provided by the pygame.draw module. Specifically, we are going to draw a circle, square, polygon and some lines. Part of the drawing, will make use of some basic linear algebra (projection of 2D vectors). This is a very basic, non-animated example, to show the composition of scenes from basic pygame elements.
- **elisa_1_spritesheet.py**:
- **elisa_2_animation.py**:
- **elisa_3_multiple_animation.py**:
- **elisa_5_statemachine.py**:
- **elisa_6_environment_map.py**:
- **elisa_7_anim_statemachine.py**:
- **elisa_8_moving_in_environment.py**:
- **elisa_9_particles.py**:
- **elisa_10_screens.py**:
- **elisa_12_sound.py**:
Play a single sound.
