# TODO: UI 2nd version
#  - simplification in terms of hierarchy chain, there needs to be a container element abstraction
#  - menu items are assigned to a menu, so explicit placement is not required
#  - for improvement - ui elements should only render into their own buffer, which will be blit to the right position
#  - font alignment left, right, center
#  - the click arguments should be simplified into sender, args
#  - support screen background and alpha blending


# A screen is a visual user interface container for our game or any other pygame application.
# It can have a menu or any other user interface component.
