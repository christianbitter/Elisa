Thank you for playing Guess My Number. Guess my Number is my first foray into game development using the Python
programming language. In particular, the game is built using the pygame framework. While the core mechanic of
a number guessing game is outright simple - you have to guess a number - all of the auxiliary components around producing
and finishing a game (like this ui) took me quite some time. And even to this day, the game is not finished.
There is many things that I marked as a todo for a next version.
