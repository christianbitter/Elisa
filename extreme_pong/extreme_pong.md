## Introduction

Extreme Pong builds on the well-known Pong game, i.e. the virtual table tennis game, where two players (their paddles) depicted by simple rects
battle each other in a kind of table tennis game. The goal of the game is one player reaching 10 points first. 
A point is awarded to the player making such a shot that his opponent is unable to reach and play (paddle contacts) the ball.
Once the ball reaches the area behind the player, the session is done and the opponent scores a point.

Now, the game increases in difficulty once the players move their paddles with full force towards the ball, this will
change angles and increase the velocity of the ball. 

However, we would like to turn Pong up a notch - making it more extreme.

## Audience

Pong Extreme will stay true to the original formula, i.e. easy to pick up and understand. Easy and fun to play. We aim
to bring this tried and tested formula to the 2000s by upgrading visual, audio and gameplay mechanics - but do not
compromise on what defines Pong. As such we envision the players to be of any age, leaning on the casual player type.
The player is someone aiming to throw a quick match against CPU or his best buddy or best gal. This is a fast paced game
so maybe a round lasts a couple of minutes, the player plays and gets on with life.

## Devices

Only PC for now. The game will be developed using Python and Pygame. At a later point either Pygame 2. or SDL version 2,
we may target different (mobile Android) devices.

## Genre

1â‚¬ Arcade game, fast-paced, action packed.

## Player Challenges and Incentives
